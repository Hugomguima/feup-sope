## [Bathroom Access](./bathroom-access)
### Description
> The aim of the project was to develop a client-server application capable of dealing with conflict situations when accessing shared areas.  
The shared area is a bathroom with several unisex seats, controlled by a ***Q*** process (server) to which requests for user access are addressed.  
Access requests are sent through a ***U*** multithreaded process (client), and the time required by the interested party to be in a place of the sanitary facilities is indicated by it. Orders will stay in a service queue until they have a turn, and at such time, the respective user accesses a place on the premises during the requested time, under the control of the ***Q*** server, then the resource is released to another user.
